# Sector Feature Implementation Plan

## âœ… Completed Tasks
- [x] Created SectorDetail model (sector-detail.model.ts)
- [x] Created SectorPost model (sector-post.model.ts)
- [x] Created SectorProgram model (sector-program.model.ts)
- [x] Created SectorServiceItem model (sector-service.model.ts)
- [x] Created SectorUnit model (sector-unit.model.ts)
- [x] Added getSectorById method to SectorsService
- [x] Updated sector-page component imports to include new models
- [x] Fixed import paths in sectors.service.ts to use correct relative paths
- [x] Added missing delete methods for all sector entities (details, posts, programs, services, units)
- [x] Fixed update methods to include ID in URL paths
- [x] Improved error logging by changing console.log to console.error
- [x] Fixed getAllSectors API endpoint to use correct path (/api/v1/sectors/getall)
- [x] Added missing addSectorUnit method for complete CRUD operations
- [x] Added missing updateSectorUnit method for complete CRUD operations

## ðŸ”„ Current Status
- All missing models have been created
- SectorsService has been completely updated with all CRUD operations
- Sector-page component imports have been fixed
- All TypeScript compilation errors should be resolved
- Service methods now have proper error handling and logging

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps (if needed)
- [ ] Test the sector-page component functionality
- [ ] Verify API endpoints are working correctly
- [ ] Check for any remaining import issues
- [ ] Update other components that might use sectors if needed

## ðŸŽ¯ Summary
The sector feature implementation is now complete with all required models and service methods. The sector-page component should now be able to:
- Fetch individual sectors by ID
- Display sector details, posts, programs, services, and units
- Handle all CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Handle all the data structures properly

All TypeScript errors related to missing models should be resolved. The SectorsService now provides comprehensive functionality for managing sectors and their related entities.
